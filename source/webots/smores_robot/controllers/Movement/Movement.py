# You may need to import some classes of the controller module. Ex:
#  from controller import Robot, LED, DistanceSensor
#
# or to import the entire module. Ex:
#  from controller import *
from controller import Robot
import time

# Here is the main class of your controller.
# This class defines how to initialize and how to run your controller.
# Note that this class derives Robot and so inherits all its functions
class Movement (Robot):

  # User defined function for initializing and running
  # the Movement class
  def run(self):

    # You should insert a getDevice-like function in order to get the
    # instance of a device of the robot. Something like:
    #  led = self.getLed('ledname')
    top_motor = self.getMotor("Bending Motor")
    # top_motor.setPosition(float('inf'))
    left_motor = self.getMotor("Left Wheel Motor")

    right_motor = self.getMotor("Right Wheel Motor")
    # right_motor.setPosition(float('inf'))

      print action(self, cmd, vel, delay, left_motor, right_motor, top_motor)

# Signifies which action robot will take
# vel indicates how fast motor will move
# delay indicates the delay prior to the command being terminated
